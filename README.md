Make Mycroft repeat whatever you want


## About 

Turn Mycroft into a parrot. Speak a phrase and listen to it repeated in Mycroft's selected voice.

    "Hey Mycroft, start parrot"
    "hello"
    hello
    "what"
    what
    "who are you"
    who are you
    "Stop parrot"

NOTE: This illustrates the converse() method

NOTE2: This will blacklist and replace official mycroft-speak skill, see [PR#8](https://github.com/MycroftAI/skill-speak/pull/8)
